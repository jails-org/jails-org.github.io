    A Modern Component Library for building front-end applications.

## Introduction

Jails is a new future proof javascript library that combines the new **ESNEXT** javascript language with **Functional Programming** and old principles of front-end development, such as:

- Unobtrusive JavaScript
- Separation of Concerns
- Progressive Enhancement
- Single Responsibility principle

## Why ?

Many libraries and frameworks out there tries to innovate in their own way. But it turns out that many of them try to do so by making development more complex then it used to be, also, they build their own ecosystem from scratch creating solutions that are already there like `routers`, `http` request modules, `UI` components etc.

They should be helping us to not repeat ourselves, to be more productive, but they are already being redundant, unnecessary complex and sadly they are not interoperable, the most of them keeps in your way making you forget the **HTML** and **DOM** fundamentals.

I see that complex questions are often used as an excuse to create unnecessary complicated answers. But I really believe that complicated things asks for simple solutions.


## Philosophy
>The HTML bad days are gone, the Document Object Model is great. It should be enhanced not replaced.

The main focus of **Jails** is to bring back the vanilla javascript development, combined with great and simple front-end technics, it provides a minimal tool belt of functions that makes your life easier in a very simple way. It should naturally teach programmers how to extract the best of the DOM and javascript functional programming.


## Manifesto
> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. ( Leonardo da Vinci )

- It should be interoperable with any other library.
- It should be updated with new discovers and keep them the more simpler as it gets.
- It should be community oriented by being extensible and keeping features away from core.
- It should be as simple as possible.
