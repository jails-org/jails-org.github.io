### Introduction

Jails is a new future proof javascript library that combines the new **ESNEXT** javascript language with **Functional Programming** and old principles of front-end development, such as:

- Unobtrusive JavaScript
- Separation of Concerns
- Progressive Enhancement
- Single Responsibility principle
- Functional Oriented

### When should you use it?
1. When you don't need a SPA with history.pushState dependency.
2. When your html markup can be rendered on server-side or static generated.
3. When you want a light bundle.
4. When you want to do more with less code.
5. When you need to reuse code behavior more then reuse view.
6. When you want to be compatible and take advantage of **any** javascript libraries.

### Philosophy

The main focus of **Jails** is to bring back the vanilla javascript development, combined with great and simple front-end technics, it provides a minimal tool belt of functions that makes your life easier in a very simple way. It should naturally teach programmers how to extract the best of the DOM and javascript functional programming.
