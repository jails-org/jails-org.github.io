# Packages

> A Realm containing a curated list of great packages found on github plus some official packages developed for Jails.

The Jails Project was created with interoperability in mind and it has to be compatible with **ANY** javascript library. Therefore, there's no reason to develop solutions that is already available in the Js Community. 

But there's a [Jails Official Packages](https://github.com/jails-org/Packages) repository created with the purpose of to list all those amazing projects, and some specific Jails Projects aswell when we think that there's a oportunity to make something different.

These modules can be installed and imported on your application just like any other github modules:

*package.json*
```js
{
    ...
    "dependencies":{
        "jails.packages":"jails-org/packages"
    }
}
```
