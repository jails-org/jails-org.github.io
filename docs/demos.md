# Demos  

> Sometimes we need more than documentations...

Demos repository was created with 2 things in mind:

### Testing Jails and Official Packages updates
I believe that tests are very important on development, but I found more interesting and productive to do so in the Demos apps, this way I can not only check if something breaks but also understand that change in a real life scenario.

### Jails Developer Perspective
The Demos are also to share the Jails Developer perspective regarding guidelines and best practices.
This is really important for those who are not familiar with the library and has not yet the idea shaped in mind.
